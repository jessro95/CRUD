# CRUD

1.Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
	I received help from Alison, Julian, and Daniel Hoang.
2.Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?
	No
3.Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
	30 hours
4.Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
	It took me a lot of hours figuring out that number of raty would be considered undefined if 0 star is received. Because of that, my average star was undefined whenever 0 star was received.
	I tried to put class for the buttons and call those buttons by class or id, but that made the reviews to be linked together and erase everything below it, or add 'helpful' or 'voted' for all the reviews that are below the clicked review.
